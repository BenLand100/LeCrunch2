LeCrunch2 is based on LeCrunch by Anthony LaTorre <tlatorre9@gmail.com>

LeCrunch2 will capture traces and settings from a LeCroy oscilloscope and
save them to an HDF5 file for later processing. It also contains a simple 
command line interface to communicated directly with the scope for manual
configuration or protocol inspection.

Features to add:
- Sequence mode capture for high speed acquisition
- Easy ability to restore previous settings to the scope
